# A Wednesday on the German rail network

A 24-hour time-lapse of one real day of German rail traffic — every scheduled
long-distance and regional train in the country, drawn from the official
nationwide timetable. The map is dark at every hour, so the trains are the
only bright thing on it.

Open `index.html` — it is self-contained, so a local double-click works as well
as GitHub Pages. No server, no build step, no network calls except the webfont.

## What is on screen

**Wednesday 13 May 2026**, from the DELFI dataset: 27,757 trains at 7,552
stations across all sixteen states.

| Category | Trips | Drawn as |
|---|---|---|
| **ICE / TGV / RJ** | 800 | high-speed, full-size dot |
| **IC / EC / FLX** | 534 | intercity, full-size dot |
| **RE / RB / MEX** | 26,410 | regional, half-size dot — deliberately the quietest mark |
| **NJ / EN** | 13 | night services, **yellow** |

Urban transit — S-Bahn, U-Bahn, tram, bus, dial-a-ride — is filtered out; at
national scale it would bury everything else. Rail-replacement buses carrying
RE/RB-style names are excluded too. Each train carries a tail so the direction
of travel reads at a glance: ten minutes for the mainline categories, six for
regional, which is also drawn at 60% of their dot size. Only the
largest cities are named, anchored by coordinate rather than by station name
(every state's data supplier names stations differently). A faint outline of
Germany with its state borders sits underneath for orientation.

The animation opens at the quietest minute of the day, found by scanning
per-minute occupancy rather than hard-coded, and runs at 4x by default: a full
day in about 90 seconds. A ring opens outward at the station where a service begins and closes inward
where one terminates, in that service's colour — at 4x the 05:00–07:00 ramp
reads as the whole country blooming awake. The strip behind the scrubber counts
the same two events across the day: services starting above the midline,
terminating below it. Both series share one ink because position already
distinguishes them, which keeps the categorical hues reserved for the trains.

The clock sits on the Baltic about 30 km off the Fischland-Darß coast, where
the nearest station is far enough away that it never covers the network. Giving
it open water rather than a reserved band hands the whole stage to the map.

Hover a train for its line and destination. Space bar toggles playback.

The window itself adapts to its container: whichever axis has room to spare is widened
towards the reach of the feed's international services. A phone in portrait
gets Germany filling the screen rather than a small map marooned between two
empty bands; a wide desktop gets the neighbours. On
phones the map keeps a full screen to itself and the legend, figures and
controls sit below the fold.

The night-train count is genuinely small: DELFI carries only the NightJet and
EuroNight runs the operators deliver to it, and ordinary ICE/IC services
finishing after midnight stay in their own categories.

## The data

`data/trains.json` is built from the **official DELFI e.V. GTFS dataset**
(licensed CC-BY), the Germany-wide timetable aggregated from all federal
states' data suppliers. The snapshot used is version 2026-01-24, valid
2026-01-10 to 2026-06-13.

The DELFI dataset normally requires a (free) registration at
[opendata-oepnv.de](https://www.opendata-oepnv.de). This copy came from the
[Mobility Database](https://mobilitydatabase.org)'s public mirror on Google
Cloud Storage — where it sits filed under catalog entry `mdb-784`, labeled
"Rursee-Schifffahrt KG" after one of the 1,174 agencies inside it rather than
after its publisher:

```
https://storage.googleapis.com/mdb-latest/de-unknown-rursee-schifffahrt-kg-gtfs-784.zip
```

`feed_info.txt` inside identifies it as published by DELFI e.V.

`data/germany.json` is the basemap: the national outline and the sixteen state
borders, from [`isellsoap/deutschlandGeoJSON`](https://github.com/isellsoap/deutschlandGeoJSON)
(Unlicense, public domain), reduced to three-decimal coordinates.

## Rebuilding

```sh
curl -o delfi.zip "https://storage.googleapis.com/mdb-latest/de-unknown-rursee-schifffahrt-kg-gtfs-784.zip"
unzip -d delfi delfi.zip agency.txt calendar.txt calendar_dates.txt \
    feed_info.txt routes.txt stops.txt trips.txt stop_times.txt
python3 build/build_gtfs.py delfi 20260513 -o data/trains.json \
    --note "All categories cover the whole country, from the official DELFI dataset (timetable of 13 May 2026)."
python3 build/bundle.py          # inlines the JSON back into index.html
```

`build_gtfs.py` takes one or more GTFS feeds and any service date they share,
so a different day, a newer DELFI snapshot, or a combination of separate
long-distance and regional feeds (such as the [gtfs.de](https://gtfs.de/en/feeds/)
`de_fv` + `de_rv` pair) all work unchanged. Classification is type-first where
a feed uses extended GTFS route types (DELFI: 101 high-speed, 102
long-distance, 105 sleeper, 106 regional rail) and name-first for plain
type-2 feeds. Times are stored in whole minutes to keep the JSON compact.

The basemap only needs rebuilding if you change the geometry:

```sh
python3 build/build_geo.py outline.geo.json states.geo.json -o data/germany.json
```

## Layout

```
index.html            the whole visualisation, data inlined
data/trains.json      generated timetable extract
data/germany.json     generated basemap rings
build/build_gtfs.py   GTFS feed(s) -> JSON, merged onto one service date
build/build_geo.py    GeoJSON -> compact rings
build/bundle.py       both JSON files -> inlined into index.html
```

## Colour and rendering

There is one surface — a near-black ground — and that is what makes the palette
work. Freed from also having to read against a light background, the four hues
are chosen purely for separation and luminance against the dark:

| | |
|---|---|
| high-speed | `#5aa9ff` |
| intercity | `#ff7a45` |
| regional | `#35d69a` |
| night | `#ffd93d` |

All-pairs CVD separation is worst at ΔE 9.9 (deutan) and 7.3 (tritan), normal
vision at 21.3, and every hue clears 3:1 contrast against the ground. They sit
above the categorical lightness band deliberately: that band is a proxy for
readability against the surface, and here the direct contrast measurement
supersedes it. Against the earlier two-surface palette this roughly doubles
tritan separation, which had been its weakest point.

The marks are small enough that pixel geometry matters. Device pixel ratio is
honoured up to 3x, and any dot whose radius falls below about 1.3 device pixels
is snapped to the device grid and drawn as a hard square rather than a circle —
same apparent size, none of the antialiasing smudge that made the regional
trains look blurred. Trail widths have a one-device-pixel floor for the same
reason.

Sky, land and the ~7,500 station dots are rendered once onto an offscreen
canvas and blitted each frame, so the per-frame cost is the moving trains
alone: around 60 fps with 1,660 trains on screen at 3x pixel density. The day
profile is likewise drawn once per resize and blitted.

Origin and termination rings come from a time-sorted event index — two entries
per service — so each frame binary-searches the live window instead of
rescanning 27,757 trips. Ring lifetime scales with the playback multiplier, so
an event stays visible for roughly two thirds of a second at any speed.
